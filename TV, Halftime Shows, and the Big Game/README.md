# TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game

This project is about the analysis of the Super Bowl games, TV viewership and halftime performances.

In this notebook, I've loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. I visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. I used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
